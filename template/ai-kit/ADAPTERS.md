# Agent adapters

| Client | Entry / installation |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | Root AGENTS and source skills in .agents/skills |
| Claude Code | CLAUDE imports @AGENTS; --agent claude copies selected skills into .claude/skills |
| Kimi / Manus | Optional short entry; supply explicitly when automatic discovery is unavailable |
| Copilot | Optional .github/copilot-instructions.md pointing to Core/current context |
| Cursor | Optional .cursor/rules/ai-kit.mdc; verify native activation in the installed client |
| Aider | Optional CONVENTIONS.md; load with --read CONVENTIONS.md rather than assuming discovery |

Existing adapters/settings are preserved or reported as conflicts. Copied Claude skills retain their three-level relative root paths; discovery must be checked in the actual client.
Private mode excludes local adapters; team mode keeps shared instruction sources visible. Personal client settings remain excluded.
Optional guards in the reference integrations/ are supplemental, not a universal command ban. They are not installed automatically.
